# Sonic Pi Jam Session
## CleRb
### February 2, 2017

# What's Sonic Pi?

* A way to make sound with ruby code
* An IDE
* Runs on many platforms
  * Mac
  * Windows
  * Linux
  * Raspberry Pi (Raspbian)

---

# Why does it exist?

* Engaging education resource
* Sits at the intersection between three core domains
  * Art - express yourself
  * Technology - time / concurrency
  * Education - open play rather than rigid structures

---

# Example #1

Play a single note, a C

```ruby
play 60
```
---

# Example #2

Now lets try 3 notes: C, G, A

```ruby
play 60
play 67
play 69
```
---

# Example #2

Now lets try 3 notes: C, G, A

```ruby
play 60
play 67
play 69
```

Notice how they all sound at the same time, is that what you expected?

---

# Example #3

Same as #2 but with a pause in between each note, so you can hear them separately

```ruby
play 60
sleep 1
play 67
sleep 1
play 69
```

---

# Example #4

With a loop to repeat a few notes

```ruby
2.times do
  play 60
  sleep 1
  play 67
  sleep 1
  play 69
  sleep 1
end
```

# Example #4

```ruby
2.times do
  play 60
  sleep 1
  play 67
  sleep 1
  play 69
  sleep 1
end
```
Right, its just Ruby!  :)

# Notes

Notes can be expressed in numbers, but you might find it easier to use the note letter instead.  Sonic Pi provides a nice set of symbos for this purpose

```ruby
2.times do
  play :c4
  sleep 1
  play :g4
  sleep 1
  play :a4
  sleep 1
end
```

I'm not a musician, but I think the two characters denote the "Note" and "Octave" of each tone generated by Sonic Pi

# Music

Very often, this is one of the first songs a child will learn to play on an instrument.  Can you tell which song this is?
```ruby
play :b4; sleep 0.25
play :a4; sleep 0.25
play :g4; sleep 0.25
play :a4; sleep 0.25
play :b4; sleep 0.25
play :b4; sleep 0.25
play :b4; sleep 0.5
play :a4; sleep 0.25
play :a4; sleep 0.25
play :a4; sleep 0.5
play :b4; sleep 0.25
play :d5; sleep 0.25
play :d5; sleep 0.5
```
---

# Sample

A portion (or sample) of one sound recording so that it can be reused

```ruby
2.times do
  sample :loop_amen
  sleep 1.753
end
```

---

# Backing Tracks

Some times you'll find that its good to play multiple threads of music which overlap one another. This is done using the in_thread method, as shown below

```ruby
in_thread do
  loop do
    sample :loop_amen
    sleep 1.75
  end
end
in_thread do
  16.times do
    play :b4; sleep 0.25
    play :a4; sleep 0.25
    play :g4; sleep 0.25
    play :a4; sleep 0.25
    play :b4; sleep 0.25
    play :b4; sleep 0.25
    play :b4; sleep 0.5
  end
end
```

# Effects

Just like many guitarists will have an effects pedal at their feet when they play, we can add effects to our sound as well.  They can even be layered on top of one another like shown below

```ruby
with_fx :reverb do
  with_fx :distortion do
    play :b4; sleep 0.25
    play :a4; sleep 0.25
    play :g4; sleep 0.25
    play :a4; sleep 0.25
    play :b4; sleep 0.25
    play :b4; sleep 0.25
    play :b4; sleep 0.5
  end
end
```
